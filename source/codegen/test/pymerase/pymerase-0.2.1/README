Pymerase v0.1

* What is it?
-------------

Pymerase is a tool for converting an XML description file into a
python API for interfacing with a database as well as the SQL
statements needed to create that database.

Thanks to the SMW project http://www.abo.fi/~iporres/html/smw.html
pymerase can also process XMI files. The parser included in the
pymerase distribution has some bug fixes that haven't been included in
the main SMW distribution but is missing their model editor and other
useful UML components. Also SMW is GPLed, and so everything in the smw
subdirectory is covered by the GPL.

The version in the subdirectory is stripped down from the full version. 
The version distributed by SMW contains a QT based UML editor, I'm only 
redistributing the parser component.

* Running pymerase
------------------

Pymerase can be run in three different ways.

1) Command line --> run 'bin/pymerase.py --help' for options

2) GUI --> run 'bin/pymerasegui.py' (currently does not work in Jython)

3) Driver Program -->
     For now, follow the example in pymerase/examples/school/createsql.py
