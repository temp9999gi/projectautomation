<H2>Loading a file into a list</H2>
<P>One of the most common tasks computer programs perform is reading information 
from and writing information to files. Luckily, Python provides a number of 
useful functions to working with files. One of the most useful is the 
<TT>readlines()</TT> function. Here's how it works. </P>
<P>You don't need to load a special module to read and write files. It's all 
built in. The <TT>readlines()</TT> function doesn't take any arguments. It's 
only job is to read a file line by line into a list of strings. Let's say we've 
got a file named <TT>groceryList.txt</TT> that contains the following lines: 
</P><PRE>bananas
apricots
Tylenol
Cap'n Crunch
milk
veal shank
</PRE>
<P>The following program would open that file for reading and load all of those 
words into a list named <TT>shoppingList</TT>: </P><PRE>file = open('groceryList.txt', 'r')
shoppingList = file.readlines()
</PRE>
<P>There's nothing magical about the word <Q>file</Q> here. I could have just as 
easily used <CODE>f&nbsp;=&nbsp;open('groceryList.txt',&nbsp;'r')</CODE>, or any 
other word for that matter, but <Q>file</Q> seems to make sense. </P>
<P>Once the file is loaded in the list, you can use all of the ordinary list 
functions that you've learned about. Have a look at this sample session: </P><PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; file =open('groceryList.txt', 'r')
&gt;&gt;&gt; shoppingList = file.readlines()
&gt;&gt;&gt; shoppingList[0]
'bananas\r\n'
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</PRE>
<P>What's up with the <TT>\r\n</TT> business? Those are the carriage return and 
line feed characters that DOS files use to mark the end of a line. (On a Unix 
machine, the end of the line is marked by a \n only.) So if you want to have 
just the word without the end-of-line characters, you need to slice them off 
like this: </P><PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt; shoppingList[0][:-2]
'bananas'
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</PRE>
