Note: the following .py files were generated by Cheetah from the
corresponding .tmpl files. I provide them so that you can see the kind
of file Cheetah generates, without having to install and run the
'cheetah compile' command yourself.

Greeting.tmpl => Greeting.py
OrderStatus.tmpl => OrderStatus.py
OrderStatusII.tmpl => OrderStatusII.py
Skeleton.tmpl => Skeleton.py
